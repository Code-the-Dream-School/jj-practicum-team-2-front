### ❗ Problem Statement
<hr/>

**Managing mentorship sessions is chaotic due to:**
> - Lack of clear session details (topic, format, expectations)
> - Missed updates caused by scattered messages in tools like Slack
 
**Fragmented Learning Management:**
> - Problem: Students and mentors struggle with scattered communication across multiple platforms (email, Slack, Zoom links)
> - Solution: Centralized platform for all mentorship activities in one place

**Session Scheduling Chaos:**
> - Problem: Manual scheduling leads to missed sessions, and poor time management
> - Solution: Integrated booking system with capacity management and real-time availability

**Attendance Tracking Inefficiency:**
> - Problem: Manual attendance tracking is time-consuming and error-prone
> - Solution: Digital attendance system with one-click marking and automated reporting

**Poor Progress Visibility:**
> - Problem: Students and mentors lack clear visibility into learning progress and goals
> - Solution: Dashboard with weekly goals, attendance statistics, and progress tracking

**Session Management Complexity:**
> - Problem: Difficult to manage session lifecycle (scheduled → ongoing → completed)
> - Solution: Status-based session management with clear transitions and controls

**Recording Access Issues:**
> - Problem: Session recordings are hard to organize and access after meetings
> - Solution: Centralized recording library with easy access and visibility controls (for future improvements)

**Communication Gaps:**
> - Problem: Lack of structured communication between mentors and students
> - Solution: Built-in messaging and notification system for important updates (for future improvements)

**Administrative Overhead:**

**Student Engagement Tracking:**
> - Problem: Difficult to monitor student engagement and participation patterns
> - Solution: Comprehensive analytics showing attendance trends, goal achievement, and participation metrics
